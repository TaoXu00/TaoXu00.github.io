Hello! My name is Xu Tao (陶旭). I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the Univeristy of Kentucky. 

My research interests span networked systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems, decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and Software-Defined Networks. 
I focus on developing AI-driven optimization techniques to enhance communication, computing efficiency, and Quality of Service (QoS), especially in resource-constrained and dynamic environments such as agricultural regions and smart cities.
