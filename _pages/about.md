My name is Xu Tao (陶旭). I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Univeristy of Kentucky. 

My research journey is anchored in the dynamic intersection of Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, 
and computer network management. Currently , my research interests are centered around the profound implications of 
Internet of Things(IoT) and cyber-physical systems on modern technological landscapes. With an unwavering commitment to 
innovation, I seek to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in addressing real-world
challenges. 

My vision extends beyond traditional applications and delves into multidisciplinary realms, exemplified by
explorations of integrating these technologies into sectors such as agriculture.
